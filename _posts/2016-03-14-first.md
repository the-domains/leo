Once more into the breach, dear friends. 

I "joined" The Grid on March 31, 2015 when I first heard about it and the crazy idea of an automated web site generator. I provide the content, the AI generates the design. Interesting idea. $96 later I was the proud holder of invite \#30205\. (Let's see, 30,205 x 96 = wow!)

So one year later I get the invite. Let's see how it all plays out. The picture above could be a sunrise. Or a sunset. It's all up to you Mr. Robot.
